# 📝 Svelte Notes App

This is a simple and responsive notes manager built with **Svelte** and **TailwindCSS**, designed for the InLabels frontend internship challenge.

Users can:
- View all notes
- Create new notes
- Edit existing notes
- Delete notes

All actions interact with a real mock API using `fetch`.
